AMAZON SCRAPER  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  
The Amazon Scraper is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to extract 
product data from Amazon's website. It enables users to gather information 
such as product name, price, rating, reviews, and product availability. This 
scraper can be useful for price comparison, market research, and tracking 
product trends over time. However, web scraping Amazon requires caution 
and adherence to their legal policies to avoid violating their terms of service.  
TECHNOLOGY USED:  
1. Python:  The core programming language for building the scraper.  
2. Libraries:  
o BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content. o  
Requests: To 
make HTTP requests and fetch web page data. o  Selenium: For 
dynamic content loading or handling JavaScript-heavy pages. o 
Pandas: For data manipulation and saving results in 
tabular formats (CSV, Excel). o  Threading/Asyncio: For multi
threaded or asynchronous scraping.  
o Proxy Middleware: For managing IP addresses to avoid getting 
blocked.  
3. Storage:  
o CSV, JSON, Excel formats for storing scraped data.  
4. Browser Automation:  
o Selenium with a headless browser (e.g., ChromeDriver or 
GeckoDriver) for scraping dynamically loaded content.  
FEATURES:  
1.Product Search and Extraction:  
Extract product details like names, prices, ratings, and reviews from 
Amazon search results.  
2.Filter Products:  
Sort and filter products based on price, rating, or availability for targeted 
searches. 3.Save Results:   
Store scraped data in CSV, JSON, or Excel formats for further analysis.  
4.Pagination Handling:   
Ability to scrape multiple pages to gather comprehensive product listings.  
5.Real-Time Price Tracking:   
Track product prices over time to monitor fluctuations and identify best 
purchase times.  
6.Product Image URLs:  
Scrape image URLs to download product images for use in reports or 
analysis.  
7.Multi-threaded Scraping:   
Utilize multi-threading to speed up the scraping process by making 
simultaneous requests.  
8.Proxy Support:   
Implement proxies to avoid being blocked by Amazon's anti-scraping 
mechanisms.
